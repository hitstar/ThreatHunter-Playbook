## Identify Required Data Sources

Before you even start measuring the quality of your data, make sure you understand and document first what data sources you actually need. This will allow you to identify what to expect and plan accordingly since day one from a data perspective. In addition, this will help you to assess your current tools and make sure they are providing the data you really need.

If you do not know what data sources you might need from a hunting perspective, you can go two ways:

* Simulate attacks in your lab, and document data sources
* Use ATT&CK to learn about recommended data sources mapped to adversarial techniques. You can use the [ATTACK-Python-Client](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/ATTACK-Python-Client) project to retrieve information about data sources mapped to techniques.
